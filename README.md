# Trends-of-Collective-Action-in-U.S.-Cities-1955-1995

Analysis of protests in U.S. using Stanford's "Dynamics of Collective Action" dataset (https://web.stanford.edu/group/collectiveaction/cgi-bin/drupal/node/21).  

Research Questions:  
- Do demographic or societal factors correlate with and influence frequency and location of demonstrations in the United States?
- What is the relationship between age, gender, income, and race with likelihood to protest.
- What is the relationship between the presence of violence, arrests, and deaths of the protests and the protestsâ€™ frequency? 
- How do the four decades covered differ in amount and type of protest?
